Our simulations are designed to comply with the\nredistricting rules that the Council abides by. We will start with the\n19 prefectures subject to redistricting and plan to expand the scope of\nour research to all 47 prefectures.\nA Whale of a\nTail: The Bank of Japan’s ETF Hoard\nPart\nI and Part\nII\n(with Nick Schmitz). 2021.

Do\npatterns of arrests in US cities show evidence of racial profiling? What\naccounts for who votes and their choice of candidates?\nThis course will teach students how to address these and other social\nscience questions by analyzing quantitative data. The course introduces\nbasic principles of statistical inference and programming skills for\ndata analysis.\nThe goal is to provide students with the foundation necessary to analyze\ndata in their own research and to become critical consumers of\nstatistical claims made in the news media, in policy reports, and in\nacademic research\nInterest-based Negotiation\nNegotiation I and II\n(交渉学 I and II)\nProfessor Jiro\nTamura (Keio University)\nKeio University, Fall 2021\nTeaching Assistant\nThis is an undergraduate introductory level course on interest-based\nnegotiation with active-learning.\n\nAbout\nNegotiation is a systematically organized methodology to overcome\nconflicts and effectively reach an agreement. In this course we will\ncover topics such as negotiation strategies based on logical thinking,\nhandling cognitive biases due to emotions and heuristics, methodology\nfor creating decision branches for effective consensus building,\neffective management of negotiation processes, multi-party negotiation,\nnegotiation based on game theory, and methodology of conflict management\nused to resolve global conflicts and disputes.
