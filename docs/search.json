Our simulations are designed to comply with the\nredistricting rules that the Council abides by. We will start with the\n19 prefectures subject to redistricting and plan to expand the scope of\nour research to all 47 prefectures.\nA Whale of a\nTail: The Bank of Japan’s ETF Hoard\nPart\nI and Part\nII\n(with Nick Schmitz). 2021.
